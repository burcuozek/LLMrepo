    "A large language model (LLM) is a deep learning algorithm that can perform various tasks. They can recognize, translate, predict, or generate text or other content. Additionally, they can understand protein structures, write software code, perform text classification, answer questions, and document summarization, as well as tasks like translation, chatbots, and AI assistants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Healthcare and Science: Large language models have the ability to understand proteins, molecules, DNA, and RNA. This position allows LLMs to assist in developing vaccines, finding cures for illnesses, and improving preventative care medicines. LLMs are also used as medical chatbots to perform patient intakes or basic diagnoses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models use **transformer models** and are trained using massive datasets. They must be pre-trained and then fine-tuned. For more information about the transformers, you can check my [link](https://github.com/burcuozek/Transformersrepo/blob/main/TransformersHuggingFace.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, transformers consist of an **encoder and a decoder with self-attention mechanisms**. Self-attention enables the transformer model to consider different parts of the sequence or the entire context of a sentence to generate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main components are: \n",
    "- Embedding layer (captures the semantic and syntactic meaning of the input, enabling the model to understand context).\n",
    "- Feedforward layer (helps to discern the user's intent from the text input).\n",
    "- Attention mechanism (enables the model to interpret input sequences effectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will see the following applications of LLM:\n",
    "1. Summarization\n",
    "2. Sentiment analysis\n",
    "3. Zero-shot classification\n",

    "The chatbot is more than fun to use: It may be the new health assistant for those who need it most in 2024 and beyond.\n",
    "Katie Sarvela was sitting in her bedroom in Nikiksi, Alaska, on top of a moose-and-bear-themed bedspread, when she entered some of her earliest symptoms into ChatGPT. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ones she remembers describing to the chatbot include half of her face feeling like it's on fire, then sometimes being numb, her skin feeling wet when it's not wet and night blindness. \n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT's synopsis? \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Of course it gave me the 'I'm not a doctor, I can't diagnose you,'\" Sarvela said. But then: multiple sclerosis. An autoimmune disease that attacks the central nervous system. \n",
    "Now 32, Sarvela started experiencing MS symptoms when she was in her early 20s. She gradually came to suspect it was MS, but she still needed another MRI and lumbar puncture to confirm what she and her doctor suspected. While it wasn't a diagnosis, the way ChatGPT jumped to the right conclusion amazed her and her neurologist, according to Sarvela. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that scrapes the internet for information and then organizes it based on which questions you ask, all served up in a conversational tone. It set off a profusion of generative AI tools throughout 2023, and the version based on the GPT-3.5 large language model is available to everyone for free. The way it can quickly synthesize information and personalize results raises the precedent set by \"Dr. Google,\" the researcher's term describing the act of people looking up their symptoms online before they see a doctor. More often we call it \"self-diagnosing.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "For people like Sarvela, who've lived for years with mysterious symptoms before getting a proper diagnosis, having a more personalized search to bounce ideas off of may help save precious time in a health care system where long wait times, medical gaslighting, potential biases in care, and communication gaps between doctor and patient lead to years of frustration. \n",
